# KaliVibe 🎧💻

**KaliVibe** is an autonomous security agent that runs natively on **Kali Linux**.

Think of it as an AI-powered sidekick for security professionals — one that remembers where it is, what it's done, and can execute real commands on your system.

> 🖥️ **Important:** Run KaliVibe in a **virtual machine**. The LLM has unrestricted shell access — protect your primary machine.

---

## ✨ Features

- **🔄 Persistent Shell** — Unlike standard LLM tools, KaliVibe maintains state across commands.
- **🎨 Rich TUI** — Terminal UI with panels, markdown rendering, and loading spinners.
- **🛡️ Safe File I/O** — Dedicated tools for reading and writing files, avoiding bash escaping nightmares.
- **🧹 Sanitized Output** — Automatically strips ANSI escape codes and bracketed paste markers for clean LLM context.
- **⚡ Timeout Protection** — Commands that hang (like `nc -lvnp`) are auto-interrupted after 30 seconds.
- **🔌 MCP-Powered** — Uses the Model Context Protocol for standardized tool communication.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

| Requirement | Version | Notes |
|-------------|---------|-------|
| **Virtual Machine** | — | **Highly recommended** for safety |
| Python | 3.13+ | Required |
| uv | Latest | Python package manager |
| OpenAI API Key | — | For LLM access |
| Node.js/npm | 18+ | Optional, for MCP Inspector debugging |

> ⚠️ **Run in a VM!** KaliVibe gives the LLM full shell access. Always use a virtual machine with snapshots.

### Installation

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/AimanMadan/KaliVibe.git
cd KaliVibe

# 2. Configure your secrets
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your OPENAI_API_KEY and preferred LLM_MODEL

# 3. Install dependencies
uv sync
```

### Running the Agent

```bash
uv run python -m src.main
```

You'll see:
```
Booting KaliVibe...

## 🛠 Available Tools

KaliVibe exposes three MCP tools to the LLM:

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `execute_command` | Run any bash command in a persistent terminal |
| `read_file` | Safely read file contents (avoids `cat` issues) |
| `write_file` | Write content to files (avoids escaping issues) |

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

Edit `.env` to customize behavior:

```env
# Required
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-api-key-here

# Optional (defaults shown)
LLM_MODEL=gpt-4o
```

### Supported Models

Any OpenAI-compatible model:
- `gpt-4o` (recommended)
- `gpt-4o-mini`
- `gpt-4-turbo`
- `o1-preview` / `o1-mini`

---

## 📖 Usage Examples

### Basic Interaction

```
User> what's my current directory and what's here?

[KaliVibe]: Let me check that for you.
⚙️  [Executing]: execute_command({'command': 'pwd && ls -la'})
📄 [Result]:
/home/kali
total 32
drwxr-xr-x 4 kali kali 4096 Feb 26 10:00 .
drwxr-xr-x 3 root root 4096 Feb 25 09:00 ..
-rw-r--r-- 1 kali kali  220 Feb 25 09:00 .bash_logout
...

[KaliVibe]: You're in `/home/kali`. I can see the default home directory contents.
```

### Security Enumeration

```
User> check what ports are listening and what processes are running them

[KaliVibe]: I'll enumerate the listening ports and their associated processes.
⚙️  [Executing]: execute_command({'command': 'ss -tlnp'})
...
```

### File Operations

```
User> create a simple nmap scan script in /tmp/

[KaliVibe]: I'll create that for you.
⚙️  [Executing]: write_file({'filepath': '/tmp/scan.sh', 'content': '#!/bin/bash\n# Basic nmap scanner\ntarget=$1\nnmap -sV -sC $target\n'})
📄 [Result]: Successfully wrote 89 characters to '/tmp/scan.sh'.

[KaliVibe]: Done! Make it executable with `chmod +x /tmp/scan.sh`.
```

## 🔧 Development

### Setup Development Environment

```bash
# Install with dev dependencies
uv sync

# Run linting
uv run ruff check src/

# Format code
uv run ruff format src/
```

### Debugging with MCP Inspector

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector uv run python -m src.mcp_server.server
```

## ⚠️ Security Considerations

**KaliVibe executes real commands on your system.** The LLM has full shell access.

### 🖥️ Run in a Virtual Machine (Highly Recommended)

KaliVibe gives an AI unrestricted shell access. For your safety:

- **ALWAYS run in a VM** (VirtualBox, VMware, Parallels, etc.)
- Use snapshots so you can revert if something goes wrong
- Isolate the VM from your host network if possible
- Never run on your primary/production machine

### Additional Precautions

- **Review commands** before letting the agent run unattended
- **Never expose** the agent to untrusted inputs or networks
- **Audit logs** regularly if using in production environments

- [ ] Web dashboard for session monitoring
- [ ] Multi-terminal support
- [ ] Command logging & replay
- [ ] Restricted mode with command allowlists
- [ ] Integration with other LLM providers (Anthropic, local models)
